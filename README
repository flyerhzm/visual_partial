VisualPartial
=============

This plugin provides a way that you can see all the partial pages rendered in browser. So it can prevent you from using partial page too much, which hurts the performance.

Install
=======
script/plugin install git://github.com/flyerhzm/visual_partial.git

Example
=======

It's easy to use. Just write in environment config file, for example, config/environments/development.rb:

  VisualPartial.display = true

Then, when you develop in your browser, you can see all the partial pages rendered.
